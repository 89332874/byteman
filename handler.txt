# Heuristic Recovery After Delayed Commit in Single JVM
#
# This script automates testing of a specific recovery scenario for the
# JBossTS XTS implementation of the WS-AT 1.1 protocol using orchestration
# rules. The scenario is as follows:
#
# AS boots
# Client starts a WS-AT transaction
# Client invokes web service 1
# Web service 1 registers as participant P1
# Client invokes web service 2
# Web service 2 registers as participant P2
# Client commits WS-AT transaction
# Coordinator initiates commit of participant P1
# ** Rule system intercepts commit and crahses JVM
#
# AS reboots
# Recovery system starts after 2 minutes
# Recovery system recreates PREPARED WS-AT transaction coordinator
# Recovery system recreates participant stub for P1
# ** Rule system adds countdown(2) for P1
# Recovery system recreates participant stub for P2
# ** Rule system adds countdown for P2
# Recovery system calls replay of PREPARED transaction
# ** Rule system traces PREPARED replay invocation
# Coordinator sends commit to P1
# ** Rule system decrements P1's countdown to 1
#
# P1 replies with committed
# ** Rule system intercepts committed message handler and aborts thread
#
# Coordinator sends commit to P2
# ** Rule system decrements P2's countdown to 1
# (last 2 steps repeated while countdown is active)
#
# P2 replies with committed
# ** Rule system intercepts committed message handler and aborts thread
# (last 2 steps repeated while countdown is active)
#
# Coordinator times out commit and writes heuristic transaction to log
# Recovery system sleeps

# Recovery system restarts after 2 minutes
# Recovery system recreates HEURISTIC WS-AT transaction coordinator
# Recovery system detects existing participant stub for P1
# Recovery system detects existing participant stub for P2
#
# Coordinator sends commit to P1
# ** Rule system decrements P1's countdown to 0 and removes countdown
# P1 replies with committed
# Coordinator sends commit to P2
# ** Rule system decrements P2's countdown to 0 and removes countdown
# P2 replies with committed
# Coordinator clears heuristic log record and copletes commit
# ** Rule system detects completed commit and kills JVM
#
# The number of participants must be at least 2 but can actually be
# more. One way of exercising the test is to start the AS and run the
# XTS demo. It should crash at the point of commit. At reboot the
# rest of the test shoudl run automatically and the server should be
# killed after a the heuristic transaction is successfuly killed. The
# console (or server) log should contain messages indicating replays of
# the prepared and then the heuristic transactions and then a message
# indicating that the heuristic transacton has committed.

# This rule is triggered when a participant stub (CoordinatorEngine) is
# created from details located in the log record. It adds a countdown
# which is tripped each time a commit is tried on the participant.
# While the countdown is active committed messages will be blocked.
# Note that it calls isRecovered() to detect that the stub has been
# recreated from the log.
# The line number is the line immediately following the invocation of
# the super class constructor. Placing the trigger after the super
# constructor call is vital for constructors since the rule cannot call
# methods on the instance until after it has been initialized. In theory
# it should be possible to set line = -1 and have the rule system compile
# in the trigger call at the correct place. However, it is not smart enough
# to do this just yet
