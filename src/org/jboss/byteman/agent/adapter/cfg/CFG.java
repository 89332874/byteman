/**
 * A control flow graph (cfg) for use by trigger method adapters. the trigger method adapter is required to
 * notify the CFG each time an instruction or label is visited and each time a try catch block is notified.
 * The cfg allows the rule trigger insertion adapter to identify whether or not an inserted rule trigger call
 * is within the scope of one or more synchronized blocks. The trigger injector may then protect the trigger
 * call with try catch handlers which ensure that any open monitor enters are rounded off with a corresponidng
 * monitor exit. the cfg is constructed dynamically as the code is visited in order to enable trigger insertion
 * to be performed during a single pass of the bytecode. See {@link org.jboss.byteman.agent.adapter.RuleTriggerMethodAdapter}
 * for an example of how the methods provided by this class are invoked during visiting of the method byte code.
 * Methods provided for driving CFG construction include
 * <ul>
 * <li> non-control instruction visit:
 *  {@link CFG#add(int)}, {@link CFG#add(int, int)},
 * {@link CFG#add(int, int, int)} {@link CFG#add(int, int[])}  {@link CFG#add(int, String)},
 * {@link CFG#add(int, String, String, String)}, {@link CFG#add(int, String, int)},
 * <li> control instruction visit:
 * {@link CFG#split(org.objectweb.asm.Label)}, {@link CFG#split(org.objectweb.asm.Label, org.objectweb.asm.Label)},
 * {@link CFG#split(org.objectweb.asm.Label, org.objectweb.asm.Label, org.objectweb.asm.Label)},
 * {@link CFG#split(org.objectweb.asm.Label, org.objectweb.asm.Label, org.objectweb.asm.Label[])},
 * <li> label visit:
 * {@link CFG#visitLabel(org.objectweb.asm.Label)},
 * <li> try/catch block visit:
 * {@link CFG#visitTryCatchBlock(org.objectweb.asm.Label, org.objectweb.asm.Label, org.objectweb.asm.Label, String)},
 * <li> trigger region demarcation:
 * {@link CFG#visitTriggerStart(org.objectweb.asm.Label)}, {@link CFG#visitTriggerEnd(org.objectweb.asm.Label)},
 * <li> code visit end demarcation:
 * {@link org.jboss.byteman.agent.adapter.cfg.CFG#visitMaxs()}, {@link org.jboss.byteman.agent.adapter.cfg.CFG#visitEnd()},
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * the cfg maintains the current instruction sequence for the method in encoded form as it is being generated.
 * It splits the instruction stream at control flow branch points, segmenting the instructions into basic blocks.
 * The control flow linkage between these basic blocks defines the graph structure. The cfg correlates labels
 * with i) blocks and ii) instruction offsets within those blocks as the labels are visited during bytecode visiting.
 * It also tracks the locations within blocks of try catch regions and their handlers and of monitor enter and exit
 * instructions.
 * <p/>
 * The lock propagation algorithm employed to track the extent of monitor enter/exit pairs and try/catch blocks is
 * the most complex aspect of this implementation, mainly because it has to be done in a single pass. This means
 * that the end location of a try catch block or the location of the (one or more) monitor exit(s) associated with a
 * monitor enter may not be known when a trigger point is reached. This algorithm is described below in detail.
 * First an explanation of the CFG organization is provided.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Control flow graph model</h3>
 * The bytecode sequence is segmented into basic blocks at control flow barnches ensuring there is no explicit
 * control flow internal to a block. The only way normal control can flow from one block to another is via a
 * switch/goto/branch instruction occuring at the end of the block. So, basic blocks are the nodes of the CFG
 * and the links in the graph identify these control flow transitions.
 * <p>
 * Normal control flow linkage is explicitly
 * represented in the blocks as a list containing the labels of the target blocks. Labels are used rather than
 * handles on the block themselves so that forward links to blocks which have not yet been generated can be
 * modelled. Labels are resolved to the relevant block and instruction index as they are visited during walking
 * of the bytecode.
 * </p>
 * The outgoing control flow link count can be obtained by calling method
 * {@link BBlock#nOuts()}. The label of the block to which control is transferred can be identified by calling
 * method {@link BBlock#nthOut(int)}. Once a label has been visited it can be resolved to a {@link CodeLocation}
 * by calling method {@link CFG#getLocation(org.objectweb.asm.Label)}. The returned value identifies both a
 * block and an instruction offset in the block.
 * <p/>
 * Several caveats apply to this simple picture. Firstly, blocks ending in return or throw have no control flow -- they
 * pass control back to the caller rather than to another basic block. So, the count returned by {@link BBlock#nOuts()}
 * will be 0 for such blocks.
 * <p/>
 * Secondly, all blocks except the last have a distinguished link which identifies the
 * next generated block in bytecode order. This link can be obtained by supplying value 0 as argument to method
 * {@link BBlock#nthOut(int)}. Strictly this link is not a control flow link and it is <em>not</em> included in the
 * count returned by {@link BBlock#nOuts()} i.e. the nett effect is that the sequence of control flow links is
 * 1-based rather than 0-based.Note that where there is a control flow link to the next block in line (e.g. where
 * the block ends in an ifXX instruction) the label employed for the distinguished 0 link will also appear in the
 * set of control flow links (as link 1 in the case of an ifXX instrcution).
 * <p/>
 * The final caveat is that
 * this graph model does not identify control flow which occurs as a consequence of generated exceptions.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Exceptional Control Flow</h3>
 * Exception control flow is modelled independently from normal flow because it relates to regions in the graph
 * rather than individual instructions. A specific exception flow is associated with a each try catch block and the
 * target of the flow is the start of the handler block. The cfg maintains a list of {@link TryCatchDetails} which
 * identify the location of the try/catch start, end and handler start locations. Once again labels are used so as
 * to allow modelling of forward references to code locations which have not yet been generated.
 * <p/>
 * Note that handler
 * start labels always refer to a code location which is at the start of a basic block. Start and end labels for a
 * given try/catch block may refer to code locations offset into their containing basic block and possibly in
 * distinct blocks.
 * <p/>
 * Methods {@link #tryCatchStart(org.objectweb.asm.Label)}, {@link #tryCatchEnd(org.objectweb.asm.Label)}
 * and {@link #tryCatchHandlerStart(org.objectweb.asm.Label)} can be called to determine whether a given label
 * identifies, respectively, the start of a try catch block, the end of a try catch block or the start of a handler
 * block. Methods {@link #tryCatchStartDetails(org.objectweb.asm.Label)} {@link #tryCatchEndDetails(org.objectweb.asm.Label)},
 * and {@link #tryCatchHandlerStartDetails(org.objectweb.asm.Label)} can be used to retrieve the associated
 * {@link TryCatchDetails} information.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Label Resolution</h3>
 * The cfg relies upon its adapter client to notify it whenever a label is visited during a walk of the bytecode.
 * This allows it to associate labels with the basic blocks and instruction offsets within those blocks. The cfg
 * provides method {@link CFG#getBlock(org.objectweb.asm.Label)} to resolve the primary label for a block (i.e. the
 * one supplied as argument to a split call) to the associated block. It also provides method
 * {@link CFG#getBlockInstructionIdx(org.objectweb.asm.Label)} to resolve a label to a {@link CodeLocation} i.e.
 * block and instruction index within a block. Both method return null if the label has not yet been visited.
 * <p/>
 * Method {@link CFG#getContains(BBlock)} is also provided to obtain a list of all labels contained within a
 * specific block. There may be more than one label which resolves to a location within a specific block. For
 * example, the handler start label associated with a try/catch handler is contained in the handler block at
 * offset 0 but is never the primary label for the block. Iteration over the contained set is used internally
 * in the cfg to resolve equivalent labels.
 * <h3>lock propagation algorithm</h3>
 * The cfg tracks the occurence of monitor enter and monitor exit instructions as they are encountered during
 * the bytecode walk. Note that the relationship between enter and exit instructions is 1 to many. For any given
 * monitor enter there is a distinguished primary exit associated with the normal control flow path and zero
 * or more alternative exits associated with exception control flow paths. The association between monitor
 * entry and monitor exit instructions is made available via methods {@link CFG#getPairedEnter(CodeLocation)},
 * and {@link CFG#getPairedExit(CodeLocation)}.
 * <p/>
 * The cfg associates monitor enters and exits with their enclosing block, allowing it to identify the start and end
 * of synchronized regions within a specific block. This information can be propagated along control flow links
 * to identify the start and end of synchronized regions along control flow paths. Whenever a block is created
 * it is associated with a set of open enter instructions i.e. enter instructions occurring along the control flow
 * path to the block for which no corresponding exit has been executed.
 * <p/>
 * For the initial block the open enters list is empty.
 * <p/>
 * For a block reached by normal control flow the open enters list can be derived from any of the earlier blocks
 * which transfer control to it. It is computed by adding and removing entries to/from the preceding block's open
 * enters list according to the order the enters or exits appear in the block. Any feed block is valid because
 * enters and exits are strictly nested so two paths to the same block cannot introduce different enters and exits.
 * Note also that this strict nesting also means that loop control flow will never require revision of a previously
 * visited block's open enters list.
 * <p/>
 * The algorithm propagates open enters along normal control flow paths whenever a split instruction is invoked
 * (splitting the instruction stream into a new block). The work is done in method {@link CFG#carryForward()}. This
 * method identifies the current block's open enters list (how will emerge below), updates it with any enters and
 * exits performed in the block and then, for each each outgoing link, associates the new block with the new list by
 * inserting the list into a hash table keyed by the link label. Clearly, if the old block was itself arrived at
 * via normal control flow then its open enters list will already be available in the hash table (it will be keyed
 * by a link contained in th eblock at offset 0 but not necessarily by the block's primary link). For blocks
 * which are the target of exception handlers a different lookup is required.
 * <p/>
 * Computing the open enters list for a block which is the target of exception control flow is also done in
 * method {@link CFG#carryForward()}. This requires identifying which try/catch regions are active in the block
 * and ensuring that the corresponding {@link TryCatchDetails} object are tagged with the location of all the block's
 * monitor enter instructions which lie between the try/catch start and end. If this is done for every block
 * encountered during the bytecode walk then at the point where the handler block is split all open instructions
 * which lie within the try/catch region will be listed in the {@link TryCatchDetails}. So, at the split point
 * the old block can be tested to see if it is labelled as a try/catch handler target and, if so, its open enters
 * list can be looked up by locating the {@link TryCatchDetails} associated with the handler start label.
 * <p/>
 * Note that there is no need to worry about nested try/catch regions shadowing outer try/catch handlers with the
 * same exception type. The bytecode format ensures that handlers of the same type are never nested (n.b. I am not
 * certain that this is not just bytecode generated by Sun's java compiler).
